<p class="pages">Pages turn<br>
My stare burns<br>
    The conflict of logic</p>

        <p class="crowd">The crowd stands in awe</p>

<h3><p>Screen in a speakeasy<br>
A man in black<br>
We've addressed many times<br>
    And call on now</p></h3>

<em><p class="thought">Thought occurs<br>
I've been here before<br>
Hear his words<br>
I've seen him somewhere<br>
The vision haunts<br>
I know him somehow<br>
As I tear my mind<br>
    I've been here before</p></em>

<h5><p class="never">Never has power risen so<br>
As we lay our bodies to the butcher called<br>
Patriotism<br>
Another shot heard round the world<br>
But this time, literally<br>
As I fall slain by faith<br>
I can almost hear liberty say<br>
I have loved just this once<br>
    But have lived and died many times</p></h5>

<em><p class="history">History books<br>
We were so young<br>
We were so strong<br>
    That's what they taught us</p></em>

<h6><p class="baring">Baring in mind<br>
It's only a book<br>
I close it and walk out<br>
    Wide eyes and all</p></h6>
