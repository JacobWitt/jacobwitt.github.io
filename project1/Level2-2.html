<div>I've been <em>here</em> before</div>
<div>Hear <em>his</em> words</div>
<div>I've seen <em>him</em> somewhere</div>
<div>The <em>vision</em> haunts</div>
<div>I know <em>him</em> somehow</div>
<div>As I tear <em>my</em> mind</div>
<div>I've been <em>here</em> before</div>

<p>Never has <strong>power</strong> risen so<br>
As we lay our bodies to the <strong>butcher</strong> called<br>
Patriotism<br>
Another shot heard round the <strong>world</strong><br>
But this time, <strong>literally</strong><br>
As I fall <strong>slain by faith</strong><br>
I can almost hear <strong>liberty</strong> say<br>
I have <strong>loved</strong> just this once<br>
But have lived and <strong>died</strong> many times<br></p>
