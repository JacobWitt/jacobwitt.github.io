        <h3>Jacob Witt <br><br><sup>Reading Response</sup></h3>
        <p>This article has brought me the closest I’ve come to understanding web development and coding than ever before. Paul Ford does a great job of cutting through the jargon of web coding and development by presenting these concepts in simple, easy to digest analogies that make the whole idea of coding a lot less intimidating and complicated.  Ford describes the computer as being nothing more than a clock that does basic arithmetic, the only difference between the computer and someone doing math with a pen and paper is that the computer can do it a billion times faster. Ford goes on to describe computer code as being a string of commands and rules that the computer breaks down into simpler code then follows step by step. Prior to reading this article I wasn’t aware that all code languages are essentially the same. What differentiates the thousands of different languages from one another is not what the language is capable of doing, but how efficient it is for a specific task. The main idea that I took away from this reading is that computers are essentially useless without the people that give them commands and that computers are no smarter than we are, but can just process information faster.</p>
